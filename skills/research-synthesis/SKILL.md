# Research Synthesis

Take multiple research sources (news, articles, reports) and synthesize them into structured insights with themes, patterns, and gap analysis.

## When to Use

- Have multiple articles/reports to analyze
- Need to identify common themes across sources
- Want gap analysis of existing solutions

## Core Workflow

1. **Input collection** - Gather 5-10+ relevant sources
2. **Information extraction** - Extract key claims per source
3. **Theme identification** - Cluster related points
4. **Pattern recognition** - Look for recurring patterns
5. **Gap analysis** - Identify what's missing
6. **Structure synthesis report** - Organize into markdown format

## Output Format

```markdown
# Research Synthesis: [Topic]

## Executive Summary
[Bullet point overview]

## Key Themes
### [Theme Name]
- Evidence: [Sources]
- Key Points:
  - Point A
  - Point B
```

## Tools

- `web_search` - discover news across web
- `web_fetch` - extract content from articles
